                    <p>I've added some banners to other websites near the bottom of the main page. I plan on adding some more music, along with a skip/previous song thing on the main page's music player.</p>
                    <p>Now that the webdev stuff is out of the way, time to talk about my life today :P</p>
                    <p>Last night I didn't go to sleep until about 7am. It's now 10:20am, and I started work at 9:30am. I quite hate working, but its something that I have to do, for the time being.</p>
                    <p>I'm mentally and physically exhausted, but my no-sugar monster energy seems to help, at least a bit. Looking forward to getting off work.</p>
                    <p>Until then, I'll keep working on the website. I'm not sure what I'll add in while I'm actually at work, but I'm sure that I'll find something</p>
                    <p>Anyway, I hope you had fun reading this. Bye bye for now!</p>

                    <p>It is later in the day, so I'm making a part 2 of today's blog to talk about personal stuff, because I don't really have anywhere else to get this off my chest.</p>
                    <p>So currently, I live with family. I'm very greatful to my family for letting me with with them for free. That being said, I ask that they don't go through my place when I'm not home.
                        I've talked about this multiple times with my family, and yet they seem to not really care about that at all. Today they went through my place, and went through all of my stuff.
                        I feel like I'm not asking for too much, and I've made it very clear that I don't want them in my place. I can't exactly move out though, because I don't really make enough money to live anywhere.</p>
                    <p>Anyway, that's all I really had to talk about. Thanks for reading.</p>
