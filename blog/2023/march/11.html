                    <p>I didn't wake up until 5pm today. In total, I slept about 16 hours. Somehow I still feel tired!</p>
                    <p>As much as I'd like to work on the website a bit this weekend, I have late homework thats due, along with an exam to take before tomorrow night. Please wish me luck!</p>
                    <p>I'm also not sure when to write my blog everyday. Doing it at night makes sense, as then the day is finished, and I can tell you all everything that happened. Though, if I do  that, I may be too tired to upload it at the end of the day, so that could be bad. Should I choose to write them early, I won't have as much to say, but I WILL have the time to do it everyday. Not sure what to do.</p>
                    <p>Anyway, that's all I have for today. I'll try and write something tomorrow. Thanks for reading!</p>
