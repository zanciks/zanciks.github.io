                    <p>Today I have uploaded this website. I'm pretty happy to see it working finally. It takes a long time for the updates to go live, thanks to github. </p>
                    <p>That being said, github is also the reason I get to have a completely free website, so I suppose its not all that bad.</p>
                    <p>I'd like to try and figure out how to make the windows dragable, so that they could be moved. I had a small attempt at this, but I failed to make it happen. I'll probably try it again at some point in the future, but not today. I think it'd be a cool feature, but oh well. </p>
                    <p>If you know how to do this, please let me know, because I would love the help. Also, the source code for this website is on github @ <a href="https://github.com/Zanciks/zanciks.github.io/tree/main" style="text-decoration: underline;">github.com/zanciks/zanciks.github.io</a> so feel free to submit any issues or requests on there!</p>
                    <p>Anyway, thanks for reading my blog today. I'm sure I'll add more to it in the future!<p></p>
