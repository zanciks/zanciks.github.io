I didn't wake up until 5pm today. In total, I slept about 16 hours. Somehow I still feel tired!
<br><br>As much as I'd like to work on the website a bit this weekend, I have late homework thats due, 
along with an exam to take before tomorrow night. Please wish me luck!
<br><br>I'm also not sure when to write my blog everyday. Doing it at night makes sense, as then 
the day is finished, and I can tell you all everything that happened. Though, if I do  that, I may 
be too tired to upload it at the end of the day, so that could be bad. Should I choose to write 
them early, I won't have as much to say, but I WILL have the time to do it everyday. Not sure what to do.
