Today I decided to fix the website. I redid the main page, and HOPEFULLY it should scale better with mobile devices. There are only two windows, now and assuming your window isn't super small, you should be able to see the music player easily. The banners have been moved to below the music player, but please make sure to look at those websites! Anyway, that's all I have for today. I have begun a new project recently, and will update you all here soon!
