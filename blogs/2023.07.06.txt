Today I added some websites to the navigation window, made the window for the banners smaller, and I'm hoping to get the music player functioning! Songs that will be available currently will be: "Clair de Lune" by Debussy, "Merry Go Round of Life" by Joe Hisaishi, one of J.S Bach's Lute Partitas, and "Save the Cat" by Daniel Pemberton for "The Bad Guys"!
One thing I'd like to work on adding is a live DJ page on this website. I'll have to figure out the logistics of making that, but if I am able to do it, people (including you!) would be able to DJ for the public ^w^
