Recently, I'm waking up late in the night. This isn't too strange, as I do work a night-shift job, and I'm sure that getting home at 2 am makes things a bit worse. However, what is weird is that when I'm waking up, I'm emotional. I'm nervous or anxious or something. I sweat and cry, and I find it hard to control. Sometimes I'll be thinking about something in particular, and that's why I get so emotional, but I'm usually not sure why I am this so unstable. It seems like something in my own head is sabotaging me. I feel like I am losing my grip on sanity, slowly. I feel like I am delving into madness. I hope that this isn't true. But if I feel like I'm going insane, and then I end up not going insane, perhaps thinking I would was the real madness. Maybe I'm already mad and don't know it.
I've also been thinking a bit today about the nature of femininity. Though still a mystery to me in general, I found <a href="https://medium.com/@thinobiafalx/monique-wittig-one-is-not-born-a-woman-74ed2fce4165">an essay which I quite liked.</a> In it was a quote, which in particular really stood out to me. It reads, "one is not born, but becomes a woman. No biological, psychological, or economic fate determines the figure that the human female presents in society: it is civilization as a whole that produces this creature, intermediate between male and eunuch, which is described as feminine." If you have any opinion at all, positive or negative, about this quote, please read the essay.
I'm sorry for the rambling. I haven't made a place for my blogs yet, so I decided to simply put it on the updates window. Maybe I'll keep them here. I'm not sure.
