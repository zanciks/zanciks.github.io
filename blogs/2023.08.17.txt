Not much news the past few days. I'm just doing my thing. Haven't updated the website either. I just want to make an update to let you all know that I'm alive lol. Anyway, I hope you are all doing well. I'm also thinking about adding a status thing to the website, but I already kinda do that with these updates, so there's probably no need. Plus, I'm not sure where it'd even go! I also forgot to commit the update, but I added some cursors to buttons. The only time you won't have a custom cursor is when you hover the chatbox!!
That's all for today I think. Bye bye folks ^w^
