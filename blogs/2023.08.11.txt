I added my tamaNOTchi to the website. Their name is Tomato and they're at the bottom of the page near the banners. Please feel free to feed them whenever :3
Also, with my new kitty; I learned that she has something called "manx syndrome". She is missing part of her spine because she has no tail. This also means she has some nerve and walks kinda funny. She also can't control her bladder. If anybody has dealt with this, I'd love to hear about your experience. The chatbox is a good way to leave messages, but also feel free to email <b>tzanciks@gmail.com</b>! Thanks friends ^w^
One last thing. I am going to get rid of mobile scaling for this website. It's a pain to manage, and I don't think many people are on mobile (and if they are, they should be on PC). Sorry if you use mobile lol
