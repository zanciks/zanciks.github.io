Hi everybody!! Sorry I haven't made any changes recently. I've been busy with work, and I just got a new cat. I'm hoping to do some things soon!
Also, if anybody has ideas on how to add some space between the music player marquee and the fieldset, please let me know. Padding doesn't work, margin doesn't work, and changing the CSS animations doesn't work. I'm out of ideas. Since its a custom CSS marquee, its a bit weird.
Anyway, hopefully I have some new updates soon. Bye bye!!! ^w^
