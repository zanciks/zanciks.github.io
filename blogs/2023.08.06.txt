For the time being, the guestbook has been removed! I had a security issue because I'm dumb and don't know how to do it serverless. Fret not, it shall return soon.
In better news, I added a chatbox. This is on the main page, too! I know that the theme isn't perfect for the website, but I'm happy with it anyway. I hope you all like it! If you prefer the guestbook, please let me know in the chatbox. Any and all input is helpful! (Also, new music was added!)
