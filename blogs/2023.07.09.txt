<p class="rainbow"> I JUST ADDED A GUESTBOOK! IT TOOK ME ALL FUCKING DAY BUT I DID IT :D</p>
I just added some very simple mobile scaling features. It's not finished yet, and there are bugs, but it is semi functional!
Another update later in the day. I added some more formatting to the guestbook for desktop users! I'm quite happy with it, and I hope you all are too. You also must fill out both the comment and the name in order to submit. Please don't spam it~
