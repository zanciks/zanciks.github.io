I fixed the volume slider and the progress bar for the music player to look a bit better for the theme of the website! I haven't tested any of this on other browsers though. If you're not on a chromium based browser; sorry! Also, this website works best on (and around) 1080p resolutions. If you zoom out too much, the music player looks weird. If you zoom in too much, you can only see the music player. Just be normal lol. You can also invert colors now. This doesn't work for the bottom two items in the music player though. I can't get that to work for the life of me! Oh well. Have fun with your light mode
