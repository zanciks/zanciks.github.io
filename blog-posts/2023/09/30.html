I've added a new blog post today. You can read it here! I've also fixed the theme switcher to CORRECTLY change the color of the progress bar and volume slider to a light mode! My code is quite cleaner, and I've started using global color variables in the CSS (I didn't know that was a thing!). The JS is cleaner too. I hope you all like this!

I've had an interesting past few days. I've hung out with friends, and have the time of my life. I saw my mother recently, which was a change from normal. She did my hair, and was quite excited about it. People online have been saying nice things to me, which has been making me (happy) cry. My laptop has gotten worse (see image) <image class="img-fit" src="../images/broken_laptop.jpg">. Things have been up and down. I also got declined for an apartment. I need to find a place to live soon. I'm trying my hardest. I start day shift at my job on Monday!! That will be nice :). It's 10am-7pm, so :D!! I think that's all I have for now, so thanks for reading this ^w^
