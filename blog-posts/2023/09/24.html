Welcome to the new zanciks.online website! I am attempting to use a new theme which I have made on my own. It isn't perfect, but I am hoping to improve it with time. On the left side, I have added a place for you to view my blog, the old website, and hopefully soon, a guestbook. If you want to use the chatbox, the old site is probably best for now. I'm not sure where it should go on this page.

I saw some friends today. It was nice. I don't get to see people I like too often anymore. I see people from work, but I don't really think of them as "friends" for some reason. Just "work friends". I do like them a lot though. There are a few that I consider to be my friends I guess. I see them outside of work sometimes. I just don't get to see people outside of work as much as I would like to. Anyway, once I finally got home today, I talked with my dad for a while. We had a long conversation about me being a tranny. It wasn't exactly what I was hoping to do today, but oh well. He kept saying how he doesn't want me to do "irreversible" damage to my body. I'm just on hrt. I keep telling him that hrt doesn't really have irreversible effects other than tit growth, which I am a-ok with. He doesn't believe me. Oh well. I wish he could understand how I'm feeling, but I know that he just can't. I don't know why I feel the way that I do. I hate being trans. I hate feeling this way. I see stuff about "trans pride" and shit all the time. I don't get it. It's horrible being trans. I just want to feel good, but every time I have to wear "guy clothes" or cut my hair short or act like I'm strong I just feel horrible. I see myself in the mirror and I hate what I see. I still only see a man. I hate it. I hate myself. I just want to change. I just want my exterior to reflect how I feel inside. I don't feel like a man. I feel feminine, but I can't express that. Being a tranny makes me want to kill myself. I hate it so much. I just want to feel good. I enjoyed seeing my friends today. I love my friends, very much.
