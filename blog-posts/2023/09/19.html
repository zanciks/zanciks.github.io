I'm sorry for not posting anything recently. I tried to post something yesterday, but it didn't save because I'm stupid. Oh well.
Today, I had to say goodbye to my kitty, Toast. Toast was an amazing cat, and I miss her dearly, already. She had gotten much worse recently, and I was very torn over what to do. With her manx syndrome causing infections, her spinal injury getting worse, and her walking getting a bit worse, it was difficult. I'm very torn up about it. I'm going to be adding a page soon with my pictures of her. I only have ~45 pictures + videos, as I only had her for about two months. I'm still very sad. I've been crying all day today. I cracked the screen on my laptop by hitting it with my head. I put a small hole in my wall, too. I know I shouldn't be angry, but I don't know how else to feel. She was my little baby. I miss her.
Rest in Peace, Toast. June 10th 2023 - September 18th 2023
