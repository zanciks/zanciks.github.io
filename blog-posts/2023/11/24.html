hai! happy late thanksgiving everybody! I hope everybody had some good turkey and pie :P. I've started work on a chess engine over the past few days. You can view it <a href="https://github.com/zanciks/chess_engine">here!</a> If you have any issues or suggestions, please feel free to add them to the repository! I'm also going to be starting on making a professional portfolio to add to the website, so once that's live, I'll be sure to show it for everybody!
