Hello!! Sorry for the long wait before updates! I'm currently moving into my own place (with some friends). I have my computer set up again, so I can now actually work on the website without the broken laptop. I can also accelerate the progress on my other projects! Super excited for that! I'm tired right now, but I'll hopefully remember to post something tomorrow or later this week! Bye bye!
