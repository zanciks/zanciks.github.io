I added a new song today. It's the title song from one of my favorite games of all time, Little Big Planet. I first got LBP when I was a kid. My family got a PS3, and I never really had any games of my own. At the time, we really only had Call of Duty games, and maybe Skate 3. I usually spent my time gaming on the Wii, where I played Super Mario World, or playing Beyond to Souls as player 2 with my brother. One day, my mom took my brother and I to Walmart. Back then, you'd go to the video game section, and you could play demos of a lot of the games. We'd just sit back there for what felt like hours playing every game we could on the Xbox's and PlayStations they had there. It was a special day though, because we got to pick out a game each. We had to keep it pretty cheap, and so I found and picked out Little Big Planet 1, Game of the Year Edition. I don't think I had ever been so exicted to try out a game. We drove home and immediately I put it into the PlayStation. My brother and I sat there as long as we were allowed and played that entire game. I remember loading in for the first time and hearing the narrator talk to us about Sackboy and how to play. I remember discovering how to make new outfits, and finding all of the game of the year special ones, like Sack Sparrow. I remember the "500 Jumps" parkour levels that users made, and spending forever trying to beat them all. I remember making my own levels for my brother and I to play. I remember the music that played, especially this song. I can barely even listen to it without crying still. Though I've probably put more time into the Souls game, and even more time into Minecraft, I'm not sure that I'll ever experience a game quite like Little Big Planet. I hope you all enjoy the song.
