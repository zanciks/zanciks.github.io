LOTS of work done today! I added a banner for Nekoweb on the right side of the screen, as you can see ^w^ I also started work on the portfolio page for this site! It's not even close to being finished yet, but I was able to get the big thing finished, so that was nice. If you want to see it, <a href="../portfolio/">click here!</a> It'll be a lot of work before I'm done with it, but I'm quite happy with the progress I've made today!!
