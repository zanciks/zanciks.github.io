I wish I knew what to do with this site. I really want to make more stuff for it. I'm considering doing a redesign, or making some new themes for the website. Maybe move away from the 1bit type where its just two colors. I don't know though. I think I just need to add some more shades of black/white for it to work! Oh well. I found a really cool website today that had some AWESOME animations that I want to try and see if I can reproduce. I'll probably try it out on some pages that aren't live, but I'm not sure yet. We'll see :P. If anybody has any ideas about things that I could do to make this website cooler, please let me know in the guestbook!
