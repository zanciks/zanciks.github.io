HAPPY SPOOKY MONTH!!! I've (finally) after HOURS of work managed to add the view counter back! The views are different for this page, so we're back to zero. Also, I've restructured what the pages are called! This page is now /home, the old page is /old, and there is /toast and /blog. Sorry for any confusion! Anyway, my script was fucking up because goatcounter does the /counter json links a TINY bit different and I had to remove a %F or something and that fixed it all. I'm happy that I know how to debug lol. I've also made the scrollbar 1bit. I'm not sure how I feel about it though. I might just leave it as default, honestly. Let me know what y'all think though! Again, the chatbox is on the <a href="../old">old page</a>, but it'll be here soon. Feel free to leave comments on that. Anyway, I hope that you all have an amazing start to your spooky month!! I might add some spooky decoration to this site. Who knows...
