Heya folks! I'm at work currently. Well, work hasn't started yet. I get here early, so today I decided to write something on here for you all. I want to work on this website more, but I'm honestly not sure what to do. I never feel like updating the blog page. I'm not sure what to add to this page. I'm not sure what new pages to add. I would love some feedback, honestly. It's also a bit hard when the website has to be serverless. Oh well. If anybody has ideas, please let me know. Anyway, I need to get ready to work now. Bye bye! 
<br> Update! I think I am going to work on making a radio station for this website, which will just be on the home screen. It'll be a floating window that goes over everything else. It'll also give me a good place to put the chatbox, so win-win!
