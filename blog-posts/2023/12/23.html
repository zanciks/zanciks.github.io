Today I readded the chatbox! It's on the sidebar, so feel free to check it out! I'm using chatango now, which is more customizable and completely free! However, it is blocked by my adblock, and might be blocked by yours too. If it is, I'm very sorry! I also got the window to open when you click in the direction while using ONLY CSS! There is no JS used for that (even though the chatbox uses JS :shrug) If you like the chatbox, please let me know. I plan on adding more to that window (its where I plan on putting the radio station), but for now, it will only be for chat. I hope you all enjoy it ^w^ (to close the chatbox, simply press the button you pressed to open it!!) <br> One more note! I just added a new 404 page! :D
