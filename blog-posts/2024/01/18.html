Yesterday I wrote about how I don't know what I want to do with the website. I think I'm going to try and add a serverless guestbook using google sheets. I don't know how well it will work, but I think it will be better than the current chatbox I have. I plan on replacing the chatbox with the guestbook when I finish it. Also, I think I'm going to watch Only God Forgives. It looks like a cool movie. Maybe I'll post what I think about it :3
