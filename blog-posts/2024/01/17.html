For the past hour (probably closer to two at this point), I've been staring at my website and other websites wondering what to add to this website. Do I just post another update? Do I add content? What do I <i>want</i> to add? I'm still not sure, honestly. I wanted to add a few low-content pages that users could click through, but I don't think that's a goal for today. So what do I do? Do I come on the website and just say "hi, sorry for not posting more frequently!" again? I mean to upload more, but I don't. Oh well. I just don't know what to do with my freetime when I have it now. I want to feel productive, but no matter what I do, I don't feel like I've been productive. I want to share more here, but I never know what to say, or whats worth putting on here. I want to add new content to my website, but I'm not sure what to add, that I can add. For example, hosting my own guestbook/chatbox isn't doable because I'm serverless, and don't really want to use google sheets. I can't find another way to host a radio station with songs of my choosing on a serverless website, either. I'm just lost on what to do here. I hope I find some inspiration soon. Happy new year. I hope 2024 is better.
