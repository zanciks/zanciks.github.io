I don't know how to feel better. I can't stop feeling so bad all the time. I wake up and feel bad. I can't focus on work or relationships. I don't want to talk to people, not even family. I fall asleep feeling bad. It's been like this for so long, I feel like I'll never stop feeling this way. Even when I'm living on my own and have income, I feel bad. What am I supposed to do? I can't just walk into a doctor's office and say "hey I feel very suicidal". Called 988 at one point. That made me feel worse. Hurt myself pretty bad at night. I didn't mean to, I just wasn't able to think. I'm tired of avoiding friends and family so they don't see me with bruises on my forehead from hitting myself. I'm tired of everything. I just wan't to feel better.
