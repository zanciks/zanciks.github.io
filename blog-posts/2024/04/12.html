Hi everybody! Not much to update with today. Just posting a little blog I guess. I woke up really early today. Went to bed around 10pm and woke up at like 6:30. Lots of sleep, gave me a ton of time to shower this morning. It feels quite nice. I'm at work early (I'm very early every day) and I'm not tired or anything. I think I'm gonna start trying to wake up earlier more often. Having extra time in the morning is awesome!
