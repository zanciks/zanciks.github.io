Ok, I've done a decent amount of work. The guestbook should work now, and be somewhat properly themed. Maybe not though idk. It takes maybe 30 seconds to update, so if you hit submit, don't be sad when it doesn't show up right away. It's alright! I'll be there! If you have any suggestions, that's the place to put them. I like working on the website while I'm at work. It makes work much more enjoyable tbh. Ok... time to find other things to do on the website. I'm at the part where idk what to do again :(. Ok that's all bye bye
