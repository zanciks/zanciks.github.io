                        For the time being, the guestbook has been removed! I had a security issue because I'm
                        dumb and don't know how to do it serverless. Fret not, it shall return soon.
                        <br><br>In better news, I added a chatbox. This is on the main page, too! 
                        I know that the theme isn't perfect for the website, but I'm happy with it anyway.
                        I hope you all like it! If you prefer the guestbook, please let me know in the chatbox. 
                        Any and all input is helpful!

                        Big news!!! I got my own domain for this website! It is <b>https://zanciks.online</b> !! 
                        I had to pay for this domain, and do some fancy wizard shit to make with work with where I
                        was hosting my website before, but it does indeed work! I hope you all like this change ^w^

                        Hi everybody!! Sorry I haven't made any changes recently. I've been busy with work, and I just got 
                        a new cat. I'm hoping to do some things soon!
                        <br><br>Also, if anybody has ideas on how to add some space between the music player marquee and the
                        fieldset, please let me know. Padding doesn't work, margin doesn't work, and changing the CSS 
                        animations doesn't work. I'm out of ideas. Since its a custom CSS marquee, its a bit weird.
                        <br><br>Anyway, hopefully I have some new updates soon. Bye bye!!! ^w^

                        <p class="rainbow"> I JUST ADDED A GUESTBOOK! IT TOOK ME ALL FUCKING DAY BUT I DID IT :D</p>
                        I just added some very simple mobile scaling features. It's not finished yet, and there are bugs,
                        but it is semi functional!
                        <br><br>Another update later in the day. I added some more formatting to the guestbook for desktop
                        users! I'm quite happy with it, and I hope you all are too. You also must fill out both the comment
                        and the name in order to submit. Please don't spam it~

                        I added a theme switcher today! You can now view the website with a WindowsXP theme if you prefer!
                        <br><br>I hope at least some of you like the new theme!! ^w^

                        Today I added some websites to the navigation window, made the window for the banners smaller, 
                        and I'm hoping to get the music player functioning! Songs that will be available currently will be:
                        "Clair de Lune" by Debussy, "Merry Go Round of Life" by Joe Hisaishi, one of J.S Bach's Lute Partitas,
                        and "Save the Cat" by Daniel Pemberton for "The Bad Guys"!
                        <br><br>One thing I'd like to work on adding is a live DJ page on this website. I'll have to figure
                        out the logistics of making that, but if I am able to do it, people (including you!) would be able to 
                        DJ for the public ^w^

                        Welcome to the new (new) zanciks experience. I've been working on this quite hard recently, 
                        and I hope that you enjoy it. So stay a while, sip your drink, and enjoy the music.
                        <br><br>With that all being said, I would like it to be known that the source code for 
                        this website is no longer public. I had to do this because I want to be able to store some data from 
                        this website (from forms and such), and if any information is sensitive, I don't want it to be public!
