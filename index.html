                        Hi everybody. I'm sorry for not posting any updates recently. I haven't had much to share recently, 
                        and I'm not too sure what to add to the site right now. If anybody has suggestions, please let me 
                        know what to add. I'm a bit lost, and I quite like my website already. Anyway, that's all for now.
                        <hr>

                        <h4 class="date">2023 August 17</h4>
                        Not much news the past few days. I'm just doing my thing. Haven't updated the website either.
                        I just want to make an update to let you all know that I'm alive lol. Anyway, I hope you are all 
                        doing well. I'm also thinking about adding a status thing to the website, but I already kinda do 
                        that with these updates, so there's probably no need. Plus, I'm not sure where it'd even go! 
                        I also forgot to commit the update, but I added some cursors to buttons. The only time you won't 
                        have a custom cursor is when you hover the chatbox!!
                        <br><br>I had a dream last night. I drempt that I was a tall, beautiful woman. There was another 
                        woman, who I was infatuated with. She told me that she was interested in me, too, but that we couldn't 
                        be together. The rest of the dream was me trying my hardest to get her. I'm not sure who she is in 
                        reality. I don't know if she is a real person, or if my brain just made somebody random up. I wish 
                        I did know, but oh well. Maybe somebody I'll have somebody I work to impress like that. For now, I 
                        have to work on myself. I have to become that beautiful woman first. 
                        <br><br>That's all for today I think. Bye bye folks ^w^

                        Super quick update! I added a page view counter. This updates hourly (I think). I also removed the 
                        tamaNOTchi because it was slowing down the website. I hope you all like the counter!!
                        <hr>

                        <h4 class="date">2023 August 12</h4>
                        Recently, I'm waking up late in the night. This isn't too strange, as I do work a night-shift job,
                        and I'm sure that getting home at 2am makes things a bit worse. However, what is weird is that
                        when I'm waking up, I'm emotional. I'm nervous or anxious or something. I sweat and cry, and I
                        find it hard to control. Sometimes I'll be thinking about something in particular, and thats why
                        I get so emotional, but I'm usually not sure why I am this so unstable. It seems like something in 
                        my own head is sabotaging me. I feel like I am losing my grip on santity, slowly. I feel like I am
                        delving into madness. I hope that this isn't true. But if I feel like I'm going insane, and then I 
                        end up not going insane, perhaps thinking I would was the real madness. Maybe I'm already mad and 
                        don't know it. 
                        <br><br>I've also been thinking a bit today about the nature of feminimity. Though still a mystery 
                        to me in general, I found 
                        <a href="https://medium.com/@thinobiafalx/monique-wittig-one-is-not-born-a-woman-74ed2fce4165">an essay which I quite liked.</a>
                        In it was a quote, which in particular really stood out to me. It reads, 
                        <b>"one is not born, but becomes a woman. No biological, psychological, or economic fate determines 
                        the figure that the human female presents in society: it is civilization as a whole that produces 
                        this creature, intermediate between male and eunuch, which is described as feminine."</b> If you
                        have any opinion at all, positive or negative, about this quote, please read the essay.
                        <br><br>I'm sorry for the rambling. I haven't made a place for my blogs yet, so I
                        decided to simply put it on the updates window. Maybe I'll keep them here. I'm not sure.

                        I added my tamaNOTchi to the website. Their name is Tomato and they're at the bottom of the
                        page near the banners. Please feel free to feed them whenever :3
                        <br><br>Also, with my new kitty; I learned that she has something called "manx syndrome". 
                        She is missing part of her spine because she has no tail. This also means she has some nerve
                        and walks kinda funny. She also can't control her bladder. If anybody has dealt with this,
                        I'd love to hear about your experience. The chatbox is a good way to leave messages, but also
                        feel free to email <b>tzanciks@gmail.com</b>! Thanks friends ^w^
                        <br><br>One last thing. I am going to get rid of mobile scaling for this website. It's a pain 
                        to manage, and I don't think many people are on mobile (and if they are, they should be on PC).
                        Sorry if you use mobile lol

                        For the time being, the guestbook has been removed! I had a security issue because I'm
                        dumb and don't know how to do it serverless. Fret not, it shall return soon.
                        <br><br>In better news, I added a chatbox. This is on the main page, too! 
                        I know that the theme isn't perfect for the website, but I'm happy with it anyway.
                        I hope you all like it! If you prefer the guestbook, please let me know in the chatbox. 
                        Any and all input is helpful! (Also, new music was added!)

                        Big news!!! I got my own domain for this website! It is <b>https://zanciks.online</b> !! 
                        I had to pay for this domain, and do some fancy wizard shit to make with work with where I
                        was hosting my website before, but it does indeed work! I hope you all like this change ^w^

                        Hi everybody!! Sorry I haven't made any changes recently. I've been busy with work, and I just got 
                        a new cat. I'm hoping to do some things soon!
                        <br><br>Also, if anybody has ideas on how to add some space between the music player marquee and the
                        fieldset, please let me know. Padding doesn't work, margin doesn't work, and changing the CSS 
                        animations doesn't work. I'm out of ideas. Since its a custom CSS marquee, its a bit weird.
                        <br><br>Anyway, hopefully I have some new updates soon. Bye bye!!! ^w^

                        <p class="rainbow"> I JUST ADDED A GUESTBOOK! IT TOOK ME ALL FUCKING DAY BUT I DID IT :D</p>
                        I just added some very simple mobile scaling features. It's not finished yet, and there are bugs,
                        but it is semi functional!
                        <br><br>Another update later in the day. I added some more formatting to the guestbook for desktop
                        users! I'm quite happy with it, and I hope you all are too. You also must fill out both the comment
                        and the name in order to submit. Please don't spam it~

                        I added a theme switcher today! You can now view the website with a WindowsXP theme if you prefer!
                        <br><br>I hope at least some of you like the new theme!! ^w^

                        Today I added some websites to the navigation window, made the window for the banners smaller, 
                        and I'm hoping to get the music player functioning! Songs that will be available currently will be:
                        "Clair de Lune" by Debussy, "Merry Go Round of Life" by Joe Hisaishi, one of J.S Bach's Lute Partitas,
                        and "Save the Cat" by Daniel Pemberton for "The Bad Guys"!
                        <br><br>One thing I'd like to work on adding is a live DJ page on this website. I'll have to figure
                        out the logistics of making that, but if I am able to do it, people (including you!) would be able to 
                        DJ for the public ^w^

                        Welcome to the new (new) zanciks experience. I've been working on this quite hard recently, 
                        and I hope that you enjoy it. So stay a while, sip your drink, and enjoy the music.

                        Today I decided to fix the website. I redid the main page, and HOPEFULLY it should scale better 
                        with mobile decides. There are only two windows, now and assuming your window isn't super small, 
                        you should be able to see the music player easily. The banners have been moved to below the music 
                        player, but please make sure to look at those websites! Anyway, that's all I have for today. 
                        I have began a new project recently, and will update you all here soon!

                        Hi everybody! It has been a few days again. Just still quite busy (or at least pretending to be).
                        I've noticed that for the past few days, I've been a bit shakey. I mean that in a physical way.
                        As I'm walking around, my body is shaking a bit, and I feel physically weak. Does anybody know what this means?
                        I would love some input to make sure that I'm not dying or something. I guess I'll just keep drinking water.
                        <br><br>I'm still sleeping at least like 12 hours a day when I don't have an alarm clock, but that's alright. 
                        I'm on spring break this week, so I'll try and get some work done on the website finally.
                        <hr>

                        <h4 class="date">2023 March 14</h4>
                        Sorry for not uploading anything for the past few days. I've been busy being lazy.
                        <br><br>All I really did today was add a new banner. I think I'll call it good from there lol.
                        I could probably add more songs to the music player, but again, I'm lazy.
                        <hr>

                        <h4 class="date">2023 March 11</h4>
                        I didn't wake up until 5pm today. In total, I slept about 16 hours. Somehow I still feel tired!
                        <br><br>As much as I'd like to work on the website a bit this weekend, I have late homework thats due, 
                        along with an exam to take before tomorrow night. Please wish me luck!
                        <br><br>I'm also not sure when to write my blog everyday. Doing it at night makes sense, as then 
                        the day is finished, and I can tell you all everything that happened. Though, if I do  that, I may 
                        be too tired to upload it at the end of the day, so that could be bad. Should I choose to write 
                        them early, I won't have as much to say, but I WILL have the time to do it everyday. Not sure what to do.

                        I've added some banners to other websites near the bottom of the main page. I plan on adding 
                        some more music, along with a skip/previous song thing on the main page's music player.
                        <br><br>Now that the webdev stuff is out of the way, time to talk about my life today :P
                        <br><br>Last night I didn't go to sleep until about 7am. It's now 10:20am, and I started work at 9:30am. 
                        I quite hate working, but its something that I have to do, for the time being.
                        <br><br>I'm mentally and physically exhausted, but my no-sugar monster energy seems to help, at least 
                        a bit. Looking forward to getting off work.
                        <br><br>Until then, I'll keep working on the website. I'm not sure what I'll add in while I'm actually 
                        at work, but I'm sure that I'll find something
                        <hr>

                        Today I have uploaded this website. I'm pretty happy to see it working finally. It takes a long 
                        time for the updates to go live, thanks to github.
                        <br><br>That being said, github is also the reason I get to have a completely free website, 
                        so I suppose its not all that bad.
                        <br><br>I'd like to try and figure out how to make the windows dragable, so that they could be moved. 
                        I had a small attempt at this, but I failed to make it happen. I'll probably try it again at some 
                        point in the future, but not today. I think it'd be a cool feature, but oh well.
                        <br><br>Anyway, thanks for reading my blog today. I'm sure I'll add more to it in the future!
