                    I'm at work and I'm bored. I've been working on adding a new guestbook, instead of the chatbox. This one will be hosted via google forms. Hopefully its usable for yall? Please let me know. If you can't, I'm @zanciks on discord.

                    Hi everybody. I haven't posted in a very long time. I recently turned 20 (back in late February, actually). On top of that, I've just been trying to get things figured out in my life. Things are getting more stable for me now, which is quite nice. I've been trying to find a better job recently, but sadly nobody wants to hire me. I'm just working on making things better. I've been thinking about my old cat, Toast, quite a bit. Most nights I go to bed thinking about her. Some nights I weep. Some nights I'm happy that I had her. Most nights I don't know how to feel. I hope I can feel better someday soon. I don't have much else to report. Everything is pretty much the same. I am about to hit 1 year on HRT, which is pretty cool! I'm excited about that.

                    Yesterday I wrote about how I don't know what I want to do with the website. I think I'm going to try and add a serverless guestbook using google sheets. I don't know how well it will work, but I think it will be better than the current chatbox I have. I plan on replacing the chatbox with the guestbook when I finish it. Also, I think I'm going to watch Only God Forgives. It looks like a cool movie. Maybe I'll post what I think about it :3

                    2024 January 17 <br>
                    For the past hour (probably closer to two at this point), I've been staring at my website and other websites wondering what to add to this website. Do I just post another update? Do I add content? What do I <i>want</i> to add? I'm still not sure, honestly. I wanted to add a few low-content pages that users could click through, but I don't think that's a goal for today. So what do I do? Do I come on the website and just say "hi, sorry for not posting more frequently!" again? I mean to upload more, but I don't. Oh well. I just don't know what to do with my freetime when I have it now. I want to feel productive, but no matter what I do, I don't feel like I've been productive. I want to share more here, but I never know what to say, or whats worth putting on here. I want to add new content to my website, but I'm not sure what to add, that I can add. For example, hosting my own guestbook/chatbox isn't doable because I'm serverless, and don't really want to use google sheets. I can't find another way to host a radio station with songs of my choosing on a serverless website, either. I'm just lost on what to do here. I hope I find some inspiration soon. Happy new year. I hope 2024 is better.

                    Today I readded the chatbox! It's on the sidebar, so feel free to check it out! I'm using chatango now, which is more customizable and completely free! However, it is blocked by my adblock, and might be blocked by yours too. If it is, I'm very sorry! I also got the window to open when you click in the direction while using ONLY CSS! There is no JS used for that (even though the chatbox uses JS :shrug) If you like the chatbox, please let me know. I plan on adding more to that window (its where I plan on putting the radio station), but for now, it will only be for chat. I hope you all enjoy it ^w^ (to close the chatbox, simply press the button you pressed to open it!!) <br> One more note! I just added a new 404 page! :D

                    Heya folks! I'm at work currently. Well, work hasn't started yet. I get here early, so today I decided to write something on here for you all. I want to work on this website more, but I'm honestly not sure what to do. I never feel like updating the blog page. I'm not sure what to add to this page. I'm not sure what new pages to add. I would love some feedback, honestly. It's also a bit hard when the website has to be serverless. Oh well. If anybody has ideas, please let me know. Anyway, I need to get ready to work now. Bye bye! 
                    <br> Update! I think I am going to work on making a radio station for this website, which will just be on the home screen. It'll be a floating window that goes over everything else. It'll also give me a good place to put the chatbox, so win-win!

                    hai! happy late thanksgiving everybody! I hope everybody had some good turkey and pie :P. I've started work on a chess engine over the past few days. You can view it <a href="https://github.com/zanciks/chess_engine">here!</a> If you have any issues or suggestions, please feel free to add them to the repository! I'm also going to be starting on making a professional portfolio to add to the website, so once that's live, I'll be sure to show it for everybody!

                    Hello!! Sorry for the long wait before updates! I'm currently moving into my own place (with some friends). I have my computer set up again, so I can now actually work on the website without the broken laptop. I can also accelerate the progress on my other projects! Super excited for that! I'm tired right now, but I'll hopefully remember to post something tomorrow or later this week! Bye bye!

                    HAPPY SPOOKY MONTH!!! I've (finally) after HOURS of work managed to add the view counter back! The views are different for this page, so we're back to zero. Also, I've restructured what the pages are called! This page is now /home, the old page is /old, and there is /toast and /blog. Sorry for any confusion! Anyway, my script was fucking up because goatcounter does the /counter json links a TINY bit different and I had to remove a %F or something and that fixed it all. I'm happy that I know how to debug lol. I've also made the scrollbar 1bit. I'm not sure how I feel about it though. I might just leave it as default, honestly. Let me know what y'all think though! Again, the chatbox is on the <a href="../old">old page</a>, but it'll be here soon. Feel free to leave comments on that. Anyway, I hope that you all have an amazing start to your spooky month!! I might add some spooky decoration to this site. Who knows...

                    I've added a new blog post today. You can read it <a href="https://zanciks.online/blog">here!</a> I've also fixed the theme switcher to CORRECTLY change the color of the progress bar and volume slider to a light mode! My code is quite cleaner, and I've started using global color variables in the CSS (I didn't know that was a thing!). The JS is cleaner too. I hope you all like this!

                    I fixed the volume slider and the progress bar for the music player to look a bit better for the theme of the website! I haven't tested any of this on other browsers though. If you're not on a chromium based browser; sorry! Also, this website works best on (and around) 1080p resolutions. If you zoom out too much, the music player looks weird. If you zoom in too much, you can only see the music player. Just be normal lol. You can also invert colors now. This doesn't work for the bottom two items in the music player though. I can't get that to work for the life of me! Oh well. Have fun with your light mode

                    I have got the music player working! It doesn't look perfect yet, but I hope you all find it satisfactory!

                    Welcome to the new zanciks.online website! I am attempting to use a new theme which I have made on my own. It isn't perfect, but I am hoping to improve it with time. On the left side, I have added a place for you to view my blog, the old website, and hopefully soon, a guestbook. If you want to use the chatbox, the old site is probably best for now. I'm not sure where it should go on this page.
