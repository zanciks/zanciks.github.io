                    HAPPY SPOOKY MONTH!!! I've (finally) after HOURS of work managed to add the view counter back! The views are different for this page, so we're back to zero. Also, I've restructured what the pages are called! This page is now /home, the old page is /old, and there is /toast and /blog. Sorry for any confusion! Anyway, my script was fucking up because goatcounter does the /counter json links a TINY bit different and I had to remove a %F or something and that fixed it all. I'm happy that I know how to debug lol. I've also made the scrollbar 1bit. I'm not sure how I feel about it though. I might just leave it as default, honestly. Let me know what y'all think though! Again, the chatbox is on the <a href="../old">old page</a>, but it'll be here soon. Feel free to leave comments on that. Anyway, I hope that you all have an amazing start to your spooky month!! I might add some spooky decoration to this site. Who knows...

                    I've added a new blog post today. You can read it <a href="https://zanciks.online/blog">here!</a> I've also fixed the theme switcher to CORRECTLY change the color of the progress bar and volume slider to a light mode! My code is quite cleaner, and I've started using global color variables in the CSS (I didn't know that was a thing!). The JS is cleaner too. I hope you all like this!

                    I fixed the volume slider and the progress bar for the music player to look a bit better for the theme of the website! I haven't tested any of this on other browsers though. If you're not on a chromium based browser; sorry! Also, this website works best on (and around) 1080p resolutions. If you zoom out too much, the music player looks weird. If you zoom in too much, you can only see the music player. Just be normal lol. You can also invert colors now. This doesn't work for the bottom two items in the music player though. I can't get that to work for the life of me! Oh well. Have fun with your light mode

                    I have got the music player working! It doesn't look perfect yet, but I hope you all find it satisfactory!

                    Welcome to the new zanciks.online website! I am attempting to use a new theme which I have made on my own. It isn't perfect, but I am hoping to improve it with time. On the left side, I have added a place for you to view my blog, the old website, and hopefully soon, a guestbook. If you want to use the chatbox, the old site is probably best for now. I'm not sure where it should go on this page.
